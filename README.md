## Send files to IPFS.

IPFS attempts to address the deficiencies of the client-server model and HTTP web through a novel p2p file sharing system. IPFS makes use of Distributed Hash Tables. In distributed hash tables (DHT) the data is spread across a network of computers, and efficiently coordinated to enable efficient access and lookup between nodes.
